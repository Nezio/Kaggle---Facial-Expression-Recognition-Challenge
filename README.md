# Kaggle - Facial Expression Recognition Challenge
Kaggle's *Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge* done post competition as a project for Soft computing class on Faculty of Electronic Engineering

### Data
Data used can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data. The file *"fer2013.csv"* from *"fer2013.tar.gz"* was used.
The file was split into separate train and test data .csv files. Private test data was used as test data and the rest was used as train data. First column and third row of *"fer2013.csv"* were removed as they were not needed.
Examples of required input data can be seen in *"example - test data.csv"* and *"example - train data.csv"*.
